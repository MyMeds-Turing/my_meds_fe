# My Meds

## About The Project

This was the Capstone Project for Turing School of Software and Design's Front End Engineering program

 Keeping track of taking prescriptions can be difficult, especially when youâ€™re not feeling 100%. MyMeds is a way for patients to add their prescribed medications to their account so that they can be reminded when to take them and be able to see when they last took a medication.
